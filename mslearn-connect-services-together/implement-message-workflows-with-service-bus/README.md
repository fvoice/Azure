# Implement message-based communication workflows with Azure Service Bus

This module looks at using Service Bus to let two apps/services communicate with each other in a transactional fashion. We will examine how to begin migrating parts of your business to the cloud, while keeping other elements on-premise and securely communicate between those pieces with a durable message bus.

This project contains the source code for the [Implement message-based communication workflows with Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/implement-message-workflows-with-service-bus/) learning module. 

The **src/start/** folder contains the starting project, and the **src/final** folder has the final, completed solution.

We recommend copying the starting project to a new location to work on the code.
